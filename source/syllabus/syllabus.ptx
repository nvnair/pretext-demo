        <title>Course Description</title>

        <p>
          This course is entirely fictional.
          There isn't even a catalog to pull a description from.
          But if there were, it would have a course description and that course description would be put here for students to read (but likely because the university administration requires it be included in a syllabus).

      <li>
        <title>Prerequisite</title>

        <p>
          TEX 100 or suitable score on the typesetting placement exam.

      <title>Course Overview</title>

      <p>
        The goal of this course is to...
        oh, who am I kidding.
        This isn't a real course, so why would I spend time writting a course overview?  I suppose I should because it helps see an example.
      </p>

      <p>
        A common thing you might see here is a list of topics we will cover.
        So the topics we will cover include,
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              How to write a syllabus in <pretext/>.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              How to write worksheets and handouts in <pretext/>
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              How to spend too much time typing up examples.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        There is more we could say here, but for now I will stop.

    <title>Assessments and Grades</title>

    <p>
      Your grade in this course will be based on a combination of your effort to master the material and the number of learning targets you master during the course.
    </p>

    <p>
      Unlike a traditional course in which you earn points for completing various tasks to various levels of success, grading in this course is done using <term>standards based grading</term>.
      One advantage of this method is that you will have multiple opportunities to demonstrate your mastery of particular standards, and what matters is how many of these standards you demonstrate mastery on by the end of the course.
    </p>

    <p>
      We call each standard a <term>learning target</term> and list these next.
    </p>


    <paragraphs>
      <title>Learning targets</title>

      <p>
        By the end of this course, you should be able to:
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              Create a new <pretext/> document, build it into both HTML and PDF output, and deploy it to GitHub Pages.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              Organize a <pretext/> document using sections, subsections, and paragraphs.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              Make up random learning targets just to demonstrate what they look like.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
    </paragraphs>


    <paragraphs>
      <title>Assessment of Learning Targets</title>

      <p>
        Three times during the semester we will have an in-class exam.
        Each exam will be your first opportunity to demonstrate mastery of learning targets related to material we have covered prior to the exam.
      </p>

      <p>
        If, after completing the exam, there are learning targets from that exam you have not demonstrated mastery on, you may attempt to demonstrate mastery on that target again by taking a quiz during student hours.
      </p>
    </paragraphs>


    <paragraphs>
      <title>Final Exam</title>

      <p>
        The final exam will take place on <alert>No day in particular, 2026</alert>.
        Probably more to say here...
      </p>
    </paragraphs>


    <paragraphs>
      <title>Assessment of Mathematical Engagement</title>

      <p>
        Your level of effort and engagement will be assessed through your participation in class and completion of a variety of homework assignments.
        <dl>
        <li>
          <title>Participation</title>

          <p>
            Every three weeks you will be asked to complete a short self assessment on Canvas measuring your level of participation both in and out of class.
            This, combined with your attendance and my perception of your level of participation, will be used to determine your participation grade (out of 100).
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <title>Daily Prep Assignments</title>

          <p>
            Prior to most classes you will have a short reading assignment or preview activity to complete.
            These will be graded based on completion.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <title>Practice Problems</title>

          <p>
            To gain procedural fluency in the content of the course, each topic will be accompanied with a small set of practice problems.
            These will be machine graded, but you can attempt them as many times as you like prior to the due date.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <title>Written Homework</title>

          <p>
            Some description of written homework should go here.
          </p>
        </li>

      </p>
    </paragraphs>


    <paragraphs>
      <title>Final Grades</title>

      <p>
        Grades will be computed based on the number of learning targets you have demonstrated mastery on and your level of mathematical engagement, according to the following table.
      </p>

        </row>
      </tabular>

      <p>
        To receive a particular grade, you must meet or exceed the requirements for that grade in <em>all three</em> categories.
        If you do not meet the requirements for a <q>D</q>, your final grade will be an <q>F.</q>
