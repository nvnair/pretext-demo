<p>
Linear expressions are used to model behaviors or phenomena that show a constant rate of change.
One way to determine if a collection of data points <m>(x,y)</m> exhibits this behavior is by plotting
these points in the <m>xy</m>-plane and then checking if they fit on a straight line.
Here, <m>x</m> represents the horizontal distance from the origin, and <m>y</m> represents the vertical distance from the origin.
The constant rate of change of a line is known as the slope of the line.

A <term>linear function</term> in the variable <m>x</m> is an equation that can be written in the form

The <term>y-intercept</term> of a line is the point where the line crosses the <m>y</m>-axis.
A <m>y</m>-intercept has the form <m>(0,b)</m> for some real number <m>b</m>.

<p>
To determine whether or not a point <m>(x_0,y_0)</m> lies on the line <m>y = mx + b</m>,
substitute <m>x_0</m> for <m>x</m> and <m>y_0</m> for <m>y</m>.
If the resulting statement is true, the point lies on the line; otherwise, it does not.

<title>Graphing Linear Functions</title>

<p>
Given two different points, there is a unique line that connects them.
Thus, to graph a line, it suffices to find two points on the line.
Knowing one point and the slope is enough to find a second point.
</p>

<p>
A linear equation may have zero, one, or infinitely many solutions.
Graphically, this corresponds to lines intersecting in zero, one, or infinitely many points.
</p>

<example xml:id="example-graphing">
<p>
Graph (i) the line with slope <m>2</m> passing through <m>(1,0)</m> and
(ii) the line <m>y=-\frac{1}{3}x+4</m>.
At how many points do the two lines intersect?
What is the solution set of the corresponding linear equation?
